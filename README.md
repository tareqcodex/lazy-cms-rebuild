## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Version 4.0.0 introduces a granular permission system with several predefined roles:

- **Administrator**: Full access to all settings, content, and system configurations.
- **Editor**: Can publish and manage all posts and pages, access media library, and moderate comments.
- **Author**: Can publish and manage **only their own** posts.
- **Contributor**: Can write and manage their own posts but **cannot** publish them (pending review).
- **Subscriber**: Access to their own profile and basic dashboard view.
- **User**: Custom role with access to Posts, Pages, Media, Comments, and Language Tools.

> **Note:** Content ownership is strictly enforced. Authors and Contributors are isolated from other users' content.

## 🎨 Theme Development & Isolation

### 📂 Strict Theme Structure
Frontend views **MUST** be located in `resources/views/themes/{theme-name}/`. 
For security and organization, any view file created directly in the root `resources/views/` folder will be blocked from frontend rendering (returns a 404).

### 🪄 Automated Theme Sync
When you update the package, your themes are automatically refreshed. To ensure this works, add the following to your `composer.json` scripts:
```json
"post-autoload-dump": [
    "@php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lazy-themes --force"
]
```

## 🌐 Multi-Language Support

Lazy CMS supports dynamic localization. You can enable or disable multi-language support from the Admin Settings.

- **Clean URLs:** When multi-language is disabled, URLs are clean (e.g., `/my-post`).
- **ISO Prefixes:** When enabled, URLs include the language code (e.g., `/en/my-post`).
- **Dynamic Admin UI:** The language selection metabox automatically hides when multi-language is disabled.

---

## 🛠 Features

- **Consolidated Migrations:** Optimized database structure.
- **Dynamic Post Types (CPT):** Create custom post types from the dashboard.
- **Advanced Hook System:** WordPress-like Action and Filter hooks.
- **Headless Mode:** Full REST API support for decoupled apps.
- **Theme Isolation:** High-security frontend view resolution.

## ⚓ Hook System Examples

### Adding a Filter
```php
add_lazy_filter('lazy_general_settings_fields', function($fields) {
    $fields['my_custom_option'] = ['type' => 'text', 'label' => 'Custom Option'];
    return $fields;
});
```

### Adding an Action
```php
add_lazy_action('lazy_after_post_content', function($post) {
    echo "<div>Related Content Here</div>";
});
```
